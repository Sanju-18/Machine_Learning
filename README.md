### Python Installation and Execution

- In order to get the development environment running, Python v3 (latest version) needs to be installed in the machine. 
    - Python 3.7.0: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/
- Clone the repository and open terminal from project directory.
- Create a virtual environment for installing dependencies. A new directory gets created.
`python3 -m venv .myenv`
- Activate it using the source command. Notice the environment name (.myenv) in terminal after executing this.
`source .myenv/bin/activate`
- Navigate into the cloned folder (`cd MachineLearning`)
- Install the requirements using pip command.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install Jupyter lab or notebook
`pip install jupyterlab` or `pip install notebook`
- Run Jupyter lab or notebook
`jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`
- Open the file and play around

## Where to find data?

### Online Data Science Competitions platforms etc 

1. kaggle â€“ Online datascience competitions ( from google) ( kaggle.com )
2. Online Data Science competitions - https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/ 
3. Quantopian: A Quant Finance platform where you can run your python scripts on financial data ( mostly secondary markets ) - www.quantopian.com  

### Code & Research Papers 

1. Papers With Code highlights trending ML research and the code to implement it. (www.Paperswithcode.com)
2. Github   - The code repository where you can find almost all types of code
3. Stackoverflow  - online community for developers - ask your doubts here. You will hit this invariably 
4. Arxiv.org  - A good repository of academic pre-prints & latest works  in ComputerScience & More recently on AI/ ML
