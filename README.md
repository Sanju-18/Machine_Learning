### Python Installation and Execution

- In order to get the development environment running, Python v3 (latest version) needs to be installed in the machine. 
    - Python 3.7.0: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/
- Clone the repository and open terminal from project directory.
- Create a virtual environment for installing dependencies. A new directory gets created.
`python3 -m venv .myenv`
- Activate it using the source command. Notice the environment name (.myenv) in terminal after executing this.
`source .myenv/bin/activate`
- Navigate into the cloned folder (`cd MachineLearning`)
- Install the requirements using pip command.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install Jupyter lab or notebook
`pip install jupyterlab` or `pip install notebook`
- Run Jupyter lab or notebook
`jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`
- Open the file and play around

### Happy Learning
